      Iâ€™m a first-year Computer Science student at AGH with a strong passion for full-stack development and optimization. 
      While currently enrolled in a front-end EPAM course,<br></br>
      I continuously expand my skills beyond front-end, exploring various aspects of software development, 
      including backend systems and API integrations.
      I thrive on learning and challenging myself with new technologies, 
      always seeking ways to improve efficiency and build scalable solutions. 
      My goal is to secure my first internship to gain hands-on industry experience and further develop my problem-solving skills. 
      I believe that continuous learning and adaptability are key to becoming a well-rounded developer, 
      and I actively work on refining my technical expertise and understanding of real-world applications.
